<blockquote>
Tell it like it is.<br />
As far as I can see.<br />
Grinning from ear to ear.<br />
Well I'll be a monkey's uncle. <br />
And you're telling me this because.<br />
Great lovers love alike; <br />
Estimated time of departure.<br />
Throwing in your two cents' worth. <br />
Message of the day.<br />
On the other other hand.<br />
Beats the living sh*t out of me.<br />
And now for a word from our sponsor; <br />
Throwing in your two cents' worth.<br />
What the h*ll does that mean. <br />
