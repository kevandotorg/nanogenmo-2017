# Tillman, Victor Lima, KOD

A trilogy of Shakespeare plays retold through the vocabulary of three historical encoding systems, for NaNoGenMo 2017. Each line of the original text is replaced with the translated code message that it is most similar to. (This is calculated using the Levenshtein distance, being the minimum number of letters that must be inserted, changed or removed to get from one sentence to another: eg. "In sooth, I know not why I am so sad" has a distance of 25 from the message "Indiana, Illinois & Iowa", closer than any other sentence in that cipher book.)
